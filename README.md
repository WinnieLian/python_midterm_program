Source(s) of dataset(s) must be clearly documented

Our data comes from the Movie Database (TMDB).  We extracted information about US made movies.

Data collection methods must be understood and clearly documented. You should read and summarize the documentation of the data, make sure that you understand and document all columns/features that are relevant to your analysis. You should understand and summarize what isnâ€™t in the data too.

We used a personal API key to extract information about movie title, revenue, budget, vote_average, vote_count, genres, production
